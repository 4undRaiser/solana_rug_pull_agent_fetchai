```python
class TokenAnalysisRequest(Model):
    token_address: str = Field(
        description="Solana token address to analyze for rugpull risk",
    )
```

## Output Data Model

```python
class TokenAnalysisResponse(Model):
    risk_score: float = Field(
        description="Overall risk score (0-1, higher means more risky)",
    )
    risk_level: str = Field(
